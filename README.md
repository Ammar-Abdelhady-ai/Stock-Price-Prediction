# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Model

This project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for predicting stock prices. The LSTM model is trained on historical stock data and then used to forecast future prices.

## Features

- **LSTM Model:** Utilizes LSTM architecture for time-series prediction.
- **Data Analysis:** Python's Plotly library is used for data analysis, providing interactive visualizations.
- **Data Visualization:** Plotly is also used for data visualization, allowing for insightful representations of stock price trends.
- **Web Deployment:** The prediction model is deployed on a web page built with Django, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, providing users with an interactive interface to input parameters and obtain predictions.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.10.3)
